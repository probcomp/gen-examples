    "Gen is a multi-paradigm platform for probabilistic modeling and inference. Gen supports multiple modeling and inference workflows, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unsupervised learning and posterior inference in generative models using Monte Carlo,  variational, EM, and stochastic gradient techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Supervised learning of conditional inference models (e.g. supervised classification and regression).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hybrid approaches including amortized inference / inference compilation, variational autoencoders, and semi-supervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Gen, probabilistic models (both generative models and conditional inference models) are represented as _generative functions_. Gen provides a built-in modeling language for defining generative functions (Gen can also be extended to support other modeling languages, but this is not covered in this tutorial). This tutorial introduces the basics of Gen's built-in modeling language, and illustrates a few types of modeling flexibility afforded by the language, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using a stochastic branching and function abstraction to express uncertainty about which of multiple models is appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Representing models with an unbounded number of parameters (a 'Bayesian non-parametric' model).\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook uses a simple generic inference algorithm for posterior inference, and shows some examples of inference being applied to simple models. The notebook also introduces a technique for validating a model and inference algorithm by predicting new data from inferred parameters, and comparing this data to the observed data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial does not cover *custom inference programming*, which is a key capability of Gen in which users implement inference algorithms that are specialized to their probabilistic model. Inference programming is important for getting accurate posterior inferences efficiently, and will be covered in later tutorials. Also, this tutorial does not exhaustively cover all features of the modeling language -- there are also features and extensions that provide improved performance that are not covered here.\n",
